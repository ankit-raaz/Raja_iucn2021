This folder contains all the code generated for the above
mentioned study. The folder contains **3** folders for each of the
models trained in the study and one additional script `functions.R`
containing custom functions used in this study.

  - **01-model\_fmm:** This folder contains all required scripts to
    train and evaluate the fossil morphology model (trained using fossil
    data).

  - **02-model\_mmm:** This folder contains all required scripts to
    train and evaluate the modern morphology model (trained using modern
    morphology data) and the predict the extinction risk of modern
    corals (using both the fmm and mmm).

  - **03-model\_mdmm:** This folder contains all required scripts to
    train and evaluate the modern morphology and distributional model
    (trained using modern data).
